The above list details the connections

the gitHub server was used to create this repository

it is stored on: 
	- locally on the stephend1 (formerly Lenovot420) workstation 
	- ubuntuServer in the lab environment.  

The connections to the ubuntuServer can be:
	- ubuntuLocal: 		uses the local DNS name within the lab environment
	- ubuntuRemote: 	uses the DDNS address of the house to port forward to
				ubuntuServer's ssh client on port 2222

This file should serve to test how commits push to both of the servers.
